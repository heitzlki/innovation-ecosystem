## <p align="center"> Case Introduction </p>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>Innovation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Different personas bring varying levels of experience, encounter unique challenges, and require tailored support. However, existing (digital) solutions often fail to provide personalized guidance, leading to disengagement when users feel unsupported or lost. As a result, many abandon the innovation process due to a lack of relevant, situation-specific insights.</p>

<h3>Expected Final Product</h3>
<p>The AI-powered Innovation Coach should ensure that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users are onboarded based on their current innovation level and knowledge.</li>
     <li>A dynamic user journey that evolves with user progress, providing relevant next steps.</li>
    <li>Industry-specific personalization is provided (e.g., an engineer receives different recommendations than a baker).</li>
    <li>The platform enables interactive engagement, answering questions in real-time and keeping users motivated.</li>
</ul>
