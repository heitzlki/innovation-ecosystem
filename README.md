## Overview

Innovation is not a one-size-fits-all process. Our solution, **Innovation Ecosystem**, provides an AI-powered Innovation Coach to guide users through a personalized innovation journey. By tailoring recommendations to individual user personas, our platform ensures engagement, motivation, and relevant next steps to help SMEs in the Canton of St.Gallen innovate effectively.

## Problem Statement

https://github.com/START-Hack/Kanton-St.Gallen-STARTHACK25

Existing digital solutions fail to provide personalized guidance for innovation. Users often feel lost, unsupported, and eventually disengage due to the lack of tailored assistance. The **Innovation Ecosystem** addresses this issue by offering:

- Personalized onboarding based on experience level.
- A dynamic user journey with evolving recommendations.
- Industry-specific insights and support.
- Interactive engagement and real-time assistance.

- **Next.js** – React framework for performance and scalability.
- **Shadcn UI** – Modern component library for UI elements.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for rapid design.
- **React Flow** – Interactive visualization library for user journeys.

### Backend:

- **FastAPI** – High-performance Python framework for backend logic.
- **SQLite** – Lightweight database for fast and efficient storage.
- **OpenAI API** – AI-driven insights and recommendations.
